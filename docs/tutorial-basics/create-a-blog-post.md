# Flower Ceremony

- The Olympic Games date back to **Ancient Greece** where **athletes** were awarded olive-leaf
  wreaths to commemorate **victories**. **Medals** were not awarded until much later in the **Games history**.
- It was during **Victorian times** that **flowers** were **first presented**
  to **victorious athletes on the winners podium**,
  a practice that was adopted when the **first modern Olympics were held in Athens in 1896**.
- The **Victorians** gave each **flower** a meaning and used the gift of flowers as
  a form of coded communication known as **floriography**.
